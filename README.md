From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The current project consists in remaking the Google homepage with the aid of inspector.

01. Created the basic HTML page structure (head, titles, links, body, header & footer)

02. HTML
    .Header Links
    .Google logo
    .form text
    .form inputs
    .footer links

03. Tried to style the menu by aligning the items to the right -     But realized that the best way to do it is to use a sub-div inside a MAIN div, that is aligned to the right.

04. Fixed the position of the menus, both top     & bottom. With the aid of black borders.

05. Everything centered & footer menu styled.

06. Redo the top nav bar - fixed the distances between each      element of the menu
